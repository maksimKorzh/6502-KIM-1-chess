# 6502 chess
Chess program written in 6502 assembly to run on <a href="https://github.com/maksimKorzh/KIM-1">KIM-1 emulator</a>

# How to run
    1. Copy and paste the code from src/chess.asm
       to the code editor at KIM-1 emulator
       (or you may try luck uploading program
        from paper the tape file)
    2. In the emulator click 'Assemble', set starting address to 0x0000, click 'Ok'
    3. Click 'Upload' button, you should see \[00 00 16\] on the screen
    4. Press 0200 on keypad, you should see \[02 00 A9\] on the screen
    5. Press 'GO' on keypad - engine would start searching for a best move
       for whites in starting position (unless you've made a move before)
       and ends up displaying best move like \[63 43 00\] which means D2D4.

# Performance
    Default search depth is 3 which is the minimal depth to search
    for a mate. With search depth 3 it takes around 1 minute to make
    a move, in a complicated middlegame positions it may take up to
    half an hour to come up with a best move. So  you may want to change
    the search depth to speed up KIM's thinking process, just alter
    the value at $0202 for that purpose. Beware though - values greater
    than 3 would take ages to complete, while values 2 and 1 would result
    in a faster play but the engine would not be capable of finding a mate,
    so if you're in the endgame, make sure the search depth is equal to 3.
